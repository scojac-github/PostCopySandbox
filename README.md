# Post Copy Sandbox / Sandbox Refresh Script

Simple script to run during Sandbox refresh to obfuscate Contact emails and reset specified User emails (currently resets all Admin Users' email addresses).

# Prerequisites

In order to use this code as configured, you'll need to create a new Public Group called "Sandbox Users". Users that are a part of this Group will have their email addresses updated post-refresh.
